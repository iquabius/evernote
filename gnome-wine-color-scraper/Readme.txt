This is a Python script to extract GNOME/GTK's color scheme and apply it to Wine, so that the themes (approximately) match.

Instructions:
1. Set your Gnome theme as you would like it
2. Run with a command like "python wine_colors_from_gtk.py"
3. Restart any apps running in Wine.  They should match the Gnome theme colors now.

Just trying out gist.github.com...


To do:

* Needs to separate out scrapers for each GTK engine where necessary.  (Can't an interface for this just be built into the engines instead?)
* Copy Gnome fonts as well as colors.  (Not sure where Wine stores these settings.)
* Something would need to call this script every time the Gnome theme is changed.

Everything else is working for me.
